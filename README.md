## About the Vulnerability
Let me take you through a real problem that's been silently affection thousand of apps across the world, Firebase a super handy easy to implement backend service that lets your app store and sync data in real-time. 

The problem lies when you set security rules
```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": true,
    ".write": true
  }
}
```
This security rules means anyone on the internet can read, write and exfiltrate entire database without authentication 

In 2018, researchers at Appthority and various independent security analysts (including bug bounty hunters) discovered that over 28,000 Firebase apps were publicly exposing sensitive data due to incorrect security rules.


## What FireSploit Does
Scans a Firebase database endpoint for:
 - .read misconfiguration (public access)
 - .write misconfiguration (unauthorized data injection)

Exploits the database (optional):
 - Reads and prints live data
 - Injects a harmless payload to simulate attack

## DEMO 


## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/secshubhamsharma/FireSploit.git
cd FireSploit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```
python firesploit.py --url https://yourfirebase.firebaseio.com
```

If `.read` access is open: 
 - It Dumps publicly accessible data

If `.write` access is open: 
 - It offers to inject a safe payload
